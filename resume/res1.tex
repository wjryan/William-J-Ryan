   I have analyzed the Blazar Markarian 421 using eleven years of gamma ray data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope. The analysis included spectral model  comparisons, light-curve transformations, and Bayesian Block analyses. The end product was a one day binned light curve and a two day binned light-curve with more more accurate flux due to computing individual spectrum for each Bayesian Block of the original light-curve. I am currently working on an auto-correlation analysis on each light-curve. A full report of my work can be found on my website above.

    I was in charge of hiring and training staff, and I built a recreational gymnastics curriculum for ages 5 to 16 in order to revitalize a stagnant program. I Increased enrollment from 30 to 130 in three months and pushed the business into the black. In summer 2019 I passed on the responsibilities to a new manager so I could pursue my college education and gymnastics career more rigorously.
