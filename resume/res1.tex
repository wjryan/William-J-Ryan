    In charge of hiring and training staff. Built a recreational gymnastics curriculum 			for ages 5 to 16 in order to revitalize a stagnant program. Increased enrollment 			from 30 to 130 in three months and pushed the business into the black. In summer			2019 I passed on the responsibilities to a new manager so I could pursue my college 		education and gymnastics career more rigorously.
